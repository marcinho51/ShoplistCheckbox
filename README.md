# Shopping List

This is shopping list application, that was created with React Create App. In this application I used: React, SASS and localStorage.

1. The aim of this application is to create shopping list. Shopping list is generated from products and recipes that you choose.
2. First you have to add products that you usually buy to Your Products. You have to enter the name of each product and choose its category. All products will be saved in localStorage.
3. Then you can also add cooking recipes with necessary ingredients in Your Recipes. They will be also saved in localStorage.
4. You can remove every product from Your Products (and localStorage) by clicking `Remove from your products` button. You can do the same with your recipes by clicking `Remove from your recipes` button.
5. Finally you can create your shopping list. If you want to add to your shopping list product, you have to enter its quantity and type of quantity (kg or items) and click `Add to shopping list` button. If you change your mind, you can remove any product from your shopping list by clicking `Remove from shopping list` button. You can do the same with your recipes.
6. This application is adding quantities of the same products. For example: if you add to your shopping list product: 2 kg of tomatoes and add recipe "tomato soup" that contains 1 kg of tomatoes, shopping list will show "tomatoes - 3 kg". It works the same with the subtracting.
7. When you're sure that you added all products that you need, you have to click `Create your shopping list` button - then you will see your shopping list: list of the products that you've chosen. When you're in supermarket and you put product from shopping list in your shopping basket, you can click the checkbox input and the product will be removed from your list.
